                        <strong> Time: </strong> February 2021 - June 2021 <br>
                        <strong> Role: </strong> UX Designer  <br>
                        <strong> Tools Used: </strong> Figma, Slack
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="project-h"> Project Context </h2>

                    <h3 class="project-h3"> About The Nonprofit</h3>

                    <p class="project-p"> Child Creativity Lab (CCL) is a nonprofit that uses hands-on techniques to foster interest in science, math, engineering, art, and technology (STEAM) in children. They do this by hosting workshops, outreach programs, and classes where students learn and develop their creativity.  </p>

                    <h3 class="project-h3"> About My Role </h3>

                    <p class="project-p"> I was 1 of 4 UX designers working alongside 10 developers. This highlighted project was done as a part of Commit The Change at UCI, a student organization that partners with nonprofits to create high quality software. As a part of the CCL team, I oversaw the designs of the lesson editing pages, including the conceptualization of designs from low to high fidelity. </p>

                    <h3 class="project-h3"> About The Problem </h3>

                    <p class="project-p">  COVID has led Child Creativity Lab to shut down their in-person events. They want to sell educational kits that can replicate their workshop experience in the convenience of families’ homes. These kits would come with an accompanying video that offers a short lesson on the topic. </p>

                    <h3 class="project-h3"> Our Solution </h3>
                    <p class="project-p">We created a video platform for users to access Child Creativity Lab’s educational content. </p>


                    <h2 class="project-h">Determining User Flow</h2>

                    <p class="project-p"> During requirements elicitation, CCL’s admins stressed their concerns about the redistribution of their educational videos.  </p>

                    <p class="project-p project-p-list">They wanted the videos on the platforms to be... </p>


                    <ol class = "project-p">
                        <li>only accessible by the user for a limited period of time</li>
                        <li>unable to be shared to non-paying customers</li>
                        <li>unable to be re-uploaded on other platforms (such as Youtube)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p class="project-p"> With this information, it was up to us to answer the question: how exactly should the user access their videos? I brainstormed possible solutions by studying what we know about the nonprofit's audience (young children and their parents) and weighing pros and cons for each idea. <b> I eventually chose idea #2, where users simply input the kit's access code to view their video. </b>
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="project-h">Turning Requirements Into User Stories </h2>
                    <p class="project-p"> For a user-centered approach, we turned the platform requirements into user stories, so they could be easily broken down as tasks for each sprint. In addition to designing for the families that would be accessing the videos, this platform would also be used by Child Creativity Lab’s admins, who will be managing the platform content. Below is an example of a user story for the admins' needs. </p>

                    <p class="project-p"> As an <b> admin</b>, I want to <b> create new video lessons</b>, so that <b> the video platform remains up to date with our curriculum. </b> </p>
                    <h2 class="project-h"> Low Fidelity </h2>

                    <img src="images/CCL/CCL Low-fi 1.png" alt="Low fidelity wireframes of admin facing 'lessons' page">

                    <img src="images/CCL/CCL Low-fi 2.png" alt="Low fidelity wireframes of admin facing 'lessons' page">

                    <p class="project-p"> I oversaw the designs for lesson management, which included the creation, modification, and deletion of lessons. Each member of the design team created sketches of potential designs. We turned these into low fidelity wireframes on Figma to get a better idea of how they would look, and through discussion, combined useful features from each of the designs. This process allowed us to practice iterative design as we were constantly testing and showcasing each of our ideas at every step of the process.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="project-h"> Polishing It Up </h2>
                    <h3 class="project-h3"> Using Shards UI Kit</h3>
                    <img src="images/CCL/CCL Style Guide.png" alt="Style guide for CCL project, including typography and colors">

                    <p class="project-p"> After combining our ideas, we worked with a style guide and Shards modal designs to continue improving our design. I continued to be critical of the features included and remained open to new ideas along the way, revising for the most seamless and practical user experience. </p>
                    <h3 class="project-h3">Using Maze For User Testing</h3>
                    <p class="project-p"> For the customer-facing view, it was imperative that we knew the design was effective, so we used Maze for remote user testing. We tested the code input/video unlocking with 19 participants to ensure that the users could achieve what they needed.</p>

                    <h2 class="project-h"> Final Product</h2>

                    <h2 class="project-h">What I've Learned...</h2>
                    <h3 class="project-h3">Work closely with your stakeholders</h3>
                    <p class="project-p"> This project gave me first hand experience with communicating with clients. Learning more about what the clients want out of the application made the scope more clear to us.

                        <br> Working closely with stakeholders also meant constant communication with the dev team. Dev team members frequently attended our design meetings to give input and update on the progress (as both teams worked simultaneously). </p>


                    <h3 class="project-h3"> Design iteratively</h3>
                    <p class="project-p"> The design process does not have to be linear. Throughout this whole process, we were constantly coming up with new tweaks and reimagining the layout. Being able to quickly make wireframes and entertain the possibility of new ideas ensured we were constantly improving our design and testing every possible avenue for the best end result.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="project-h3">Be critical of every design decision</h3>
                    <p class="project-p">As designers, we questioned every feature that went on the end product. Some features seemed like a good idea in theory, but they ended up being unnecessary. Being skeptical allowed us to create a product that had meaningful, straightforward features without any additional clutter.
                    </p>
